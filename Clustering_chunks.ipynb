It was meant to be symbolical, of course.\\n In the old tradition. It was in the way of an antique, being one of the\\n timepieces made generations past in the Alpine area of Eur-Asia. Its\\n quaintness lay in the fact that it was wound, not electronically by\\n power-radio, but by the actual physical movements of the bearer, a free\\n swinging rotor keeping the mainspring at a constant tension.\\n\\n\\n They also had a banquet for him, complete with speeches by such\\n bigwigs of the Department of Space Exploration as Academician Lofting\\n Gubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux. There was also somebody\\n from the government who spoke, but he was one of those who were\\n pseudo-elected and didn\\'t know much about the field of space travel\\n nor the significance of Seymour Pond\\'s retirement. Si didn\\'t bother to\\n remember his name. He only wondered vaguely why the cloddy had turned\\n up at all.\\n\\n\\n In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generations\\n before him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangible\\n in the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add to\\n his portfolio. But that, he supposed, was asking too much.\\n\\n\\n The fact of the matter was, Si knew that his retiring had set them\\n back. They hadn\\'t figured he had enough shares of Basic to see him\\n through decently. Well, possibly he didn\\'t, given their standards.\\n But Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn\\'t have their standards. He\\'d had\\n plenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limited\\n crediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two or\\n three more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard.\\n\\n\\n He\\'d had plenty of time to figure it out, there alone in space on the\\n Moon run, there on the Venus or Mars runs. There on the long, long\\n haul to the Jupiter satellites, fearfully checking the symptoms of\\n space cafard, the madness compounded of claustrophobia, monotony,\\n boredom and free fall. Plenty of time. Time to decide that a one\\n room mini-auto-apartment, complete with an autochair and built-in\\n autobar, and with one wall a teevee screen, was all he needed to\\n find contentment for a mighty long time. Possibly somebody like\\n Doc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in a\\n mini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomy\\n beyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.\\n\\n\\n No. Even as Si listened to their speeches, accepted the watch and\\n made a halting little talk of his own, he was grinning inwardly. There\\n wasn\\'t anything they could do. He had them now. He had enough Basic to\\n keep him comfortably, by his standards, for the rest of his life. He\\n was never going to subject himself to space cafard again. Just thinking\\n about it, now, set the tic to going at the side of his mouth.\\n\\n\\n They could count down and blast off, for all he gave a damn.\\nThe gold watch idea had been that of Lofting Gubelin, which was\\n typical, he being in the way of a living anachronism himself. In fact,\\n Academician Gubelin was possibly the only living man on North America\\n who still wore spectacles. His explanation was that a phobia against\\n having his eyes touched prohibited either surgery to remould his\\n eyeballs and cure his myopia, or contact lenses.\\n\\n\\n That was only an alibi so far as his closest associate, Hans\\n Girard-Perregaux, was concerned. Doctor Girard-Perregaux was convinced\\n Gubelin would have even worn facial hair, had he but a touch more\\n courage. Gubelin longed for yesteryear, a seldom found phenomenon under\\n the Ultrawelfare State.\\n\\n\\n Slumped in an autochair in the escape room of his Floridian home,\\n Lofting Gubelin scowled at his friend. He said, acidly, \"Any more\\n bright schemes, Hans? I presume you now acknowledge that appealing to\\n the cloddy\\'s patriotism, sentiment and desire for public acclaim have\\n miserably failed.\"\\n\\n\\n Girard-Perregaux said easily, \"I wouldn\\'t call Seymour Pond a cloddy.\\n In his position, I am afraid I would do the same thing he has.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s nonsense, Hans. Zoroaster! Either you or I would gladly take\\n Pond\\'s place were we capable of performing the duties for which he has\\n been trained. There aren\\'t two men on North America—there aren\\'t two\\n men in the world!—who better realize the urgency of continuing our\\n delving into space.\" Gubelin snapped his fingers. \"Like that, either of\\n us would give our lives to prevent man from completely abandoning the\\n road to his destiny.\"\\n\\n\\n His friend said drily, \"Either of us could have volunteered for pilot\\n training forty years ago, Lofting. We didn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\\n \"At that time there wasn\\'t such a blistering percentage of funkers\\n throughout this whole blistering Ultrawelfare State! Who could\\n foresee that eventually our whole program would face ending due to\\n lack of courageous young men willing to take chances, willing to face\\n adventure, willing to react to the stimulus of danger in the manner our\\n ancestors did?\"\\n\\n\\n Girard-Perregaux grunted his sarcasm and dialed a glass of iced tea\\n and tequila. He said, \"Nevertheless, both you and I conform with the\\n present generation in finding it far more pleasant to follow one\\'s\\n way of life in the comfort of one\\'s home than to be confronted with\\n the unpleasantness of facing nature\\'s dangers in more adventurous\\n pastimes.\"\\n\\n\\n Gubelin, half angry at his friend\\'s argument, leaned forward to snap\\n rebuttal, but the other was wagging a finger at him negatively. \"Face\\n reality, Lofting. Don\\'t require or expect from Seymour Pond more\\n than is to be found there. He is an average young man. Born in our\\n Ultrawelfare State, he was guaranteed his fundamental womb-to-tomb\\n security by being issued that minimum number of Basic shares in our\\n society that allows him an income sufficient to secure the food,\\n clothing, shelter, medical care and education to sustain a low level\\n of subsistence. Percentages were against his ever being drafted\\n into industry. Automation being what it is, only a fraction of the\\n population is ever called up. But Pond was. His industrial aptitude\\n dossier revealed him a possible candidate for space pilot, and it was\\n you yourself who talked him into taking the training ... pointing out\\n the more pragmatic advantages such as complete retirement after but six\\n trips, added shares of Basic so that he could enjoy a more comfortable\\n life than most and the fame that would accrue to him as one of the\\n very few who still participate in travel to the planets. Very well.\\n He was sold. Took his training, which, of course, required long years\\n of drudgery to him. Then, performing his duties quite competently, he\\n made his six trips. He is now legally eligible for retirement. He was\\n drafted into the working force reserves, served his time, and is now\\n free from toil for the balance of his life. Why should he listen to\\n our pleas for a few more trips?\"\\n\\n\\n \"But has he no spirit of adventure? Has he no feeling for....\"\\nGirard-Perregaux was wagging his finger again, a gesture that,\\n seemingly mild though it was, had an astonishing ability to break off\\n the conversation of one who debated with the easy-seeming, quiet spoken\\n man.\\n\\n\\n He said, \"No, he hasn\\'t. Few there are who have, nowadays. Man has\\n always paid lip service to adventure, hardships and excitement, but in\\n actuality his instincts, like those of any other animal, lead him to\\n the least dangerous path. Today we\\'ve reached the point where no one\\n need face danger—ever. There are few who don\\'t take advantage of the\\n fact. Including you and me, Lofting, and including Seymour Pond.\"\\n\\n\\n His friend and colleague changed subjects abruptly, impatiently. \"Let\\'s\\n leave this blistering jabber about Pond\\'s motivation and get to the\\n point. The man is the only trained space pilot in the world. It will\\n take months, possibly more than a year, to bring another novitiate\\n pilot to the point where he can safely be trusted to take our next\\n explorer craft out. Appropriations for our expeditions have been\\n increasingly hard to come by—even though in\\nour\\nminds, Hans, we are\\n near important breakthroughs, breakthroughs which might possibly so\\n spark the race that a new dream to push man out to the stars will take\\n hold of us. If it is admitted that our organization has degenerated\\n to the point that we haven\\'t a single pilot, then it might well be\\n that the Economic Planning Board, and especially those cloddies\\n on Appropriations, will terminate the whole Department of Space\\n Exploration.\"\\n\\n\\n \"So....\" Girard-Perregaux said gently.\\n\\n\\n \"So some way we\\'ve got to bring Seymour Pond out of his retirement!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Now we are getting to matters.\" Girard-Perregaux nodded his agreement.\\n Looking over the rim of his glass, his eyes narrowed in thought as his\\n face took on an expression of Machiavellianism. \"And do not the ends\\n justify the means?\"\\n\\n\\n Gubelin blinked at him.\\n\\n\\n The other chuckled. \"The trouble with you, Lofting, is that you have\\n failed to bring history to bear on our problem. Haven\\'t you ever read\\n of the sailor and his way of life?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sailor? What in the name of the living Zoroaster has the sailor got to\\n do with it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You must realize, my dear Lofting, that our Si Pond is nothing more\\n than a latter-day sailor, with many of the problems and view-points,\\n tendencies and weaknesses of the voyager of the past. Have you never\\n heard of the seaman who dreamed of returning to the village of his\\n birth and buying a chicken farm or some such? All the long months at\\n sea—and sometimes the tramp freighters or whaling craft would be out\\n for years at a stretch before returning to home port—he would talk\\n of his retirement and his dream. And then? Then in port, it would be\\n one short drink with the boys, before taking his accumulated pay and\\n heading home. The one short drink would lead to another. And morning\\n would find him, drunk, rolled, tattooed and possibly sleeping it off in\\n jail. So back to sea he\\'d have to go.\"\\n\\n\\n Gubelin grunted bitterly. \"Unfortunately, our present-day sailor\\n can\\'t be separated from his money quite so easily. If he could, I\\'d\\n personally be willing to lure him down some dark alley, knock him over\\n the head and roll him myself. Just to bring him back to his job again.\"\\n\\n\\n He brought his wallet from his pocket, and flicked it open to his\\n universal credit card. \"The ultimate means of exchange,\" he grunted.\\n \"Nobody can spend your money, but you, yourself. Nobody can steal it,\\n nobody can, ah,\\ncon\\nyou out of it. Just how do you expect to sever\\n our present-day sailor and his accumulated nest egg?\"\\n\\n\\n The other chuckled again. \"It is simply a matter of finding more modern\\n methods, my dear chap.\"\\nII\\n\\n\\n Si Pond was a great believer in the institution of the spree. Any\\n excuse would do. Back when he had finished basic education at the age\\n of twenty-five and was registered for the labor draft, there hadn\\'t\\n been a chance in a hundred that he\\'d have the bad luck to have his\\n name pulled. But when it had been, Si had celebrated.\\n\\n\\n When he had been informed that his physical and mental qualifications\\n were such that he was eligible for the most dangerous occupation in\\n the Ultrawelfare State and had been pressured into taking training\\n for space pilot, he had celebrated once again. Twenty-two others had\\n taken the training with him, and only he and Rod Cameroon had passed\\n the finals. On this occasion, he and Rod had celebrated together. It\\n had been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faulty\\n take-off on what should have been a routine Moon run.\\n\\n\\n Each time Si returned from one of his own runs, he celebrated. A spree,\\n a bust, a bat, a wing-ding, a night on the town. A commemoration of\\n dangers met and passed.\\n\\n\\n Now it was all over. At the age of thirty he was retired. Law prevented\\n him from ever being called up for contributing to the country\\'s labor\\n needs again. And he most certainly wasn\\'t going to volunteer.\\n\\n\\n He had taken his schooling much as had his contemporaries. There wasn\\'t\\n any particular reason for trying to excell. You didn\\'t want to get the\\n reputation for being a wise guy, or a cloddy either. Just one of the\\n fellas. You could do the same in life whether you really studied or\\n not. You had your Inalienable Basic stock, didn\\'t you? What else did\\n you need?\\n\\n\\n It had come as a surprise when he\\'d been drafted for the labor force.\\n\\n\\n In the early days of the Ultrawelfare State, they had made a mistake\\n in adapting to the automation of the second industrial revolution.\\n They had attempted to give everyone work by reducing the number of\\n working hours in the day, and the number of working days in the week.\\n It finally became ludicrous when employees of industry were working\\n but two days a week, two hours a day. In fact, it got chaotic. It\\n became obvious that it was more practical to have one worker putting in\\n thirty-five hours a week and getting to know his job well, than it was\\n to have a score of employees, each working a few hours a week and none\\n of them ever really becoming efficient.\\n\\n\\n The only fair thing was to let the technologically unemployed remain\\n unemployed, with their Inalienable Basic stock as the equivalent of\\n unemployment insurance, while the few workers still needed put in a\\n reasonable number of hours a day, a reasonable number of weeks a year\\n and a reasonable number of years in a life time. When new employees\\n were needed, a draft lottery was held.\\n\\n\\n All persons registered in the labor force participated. If you\\n were drawn, you must need serve. The dissatisfaction those chosen\\n might feel at their poor luck was offset by the fact that they were\\n granted additional Variable Basic shares, according to the tasks\\n they fulfilled. Such shares could be added to their portfolios, the\\n dividends becoming part of their current credit balance, or could be\\n sold for a lump sum on the market.\\n\\n\\n Yes, but now it was all over. He had his own little place, his own\\n vacuum-tube vehicle and twice the amount of shares of Basic that most\\n of his fellow citizens could boast. Si Pond had it made. A spree was\\n obviously called for.\\n\\n\\n He was going to do this one right. This was the big one. He\\'d\\n accumulated a lot of dollars these past few months and he intended\\n to blow them, or at least a sizeable number of them. His credit card\\n was burning a hole in his pocket, as the expression went. However, he\\n wasn\\'t going to rush into things. This had to be done correctly.\\n\\n\\n Too many a spree was played by ear. You started off with a few drinks,\\n fell in with some second rate mopsy and usually wound up in a third\\n rate groggery where you spent just as much as though you\\'d been in the\\n classiest joint in town. Came morning and you had nothing to show for\\n all the dollars that had been spent but a rum-head.\\n\\n\\n Thus, Si was vaguely aware, it had always been down through the\\n centuries since the Phoenecian sailor, back from his year-long trip to\\n the tin mines of Cornwall, blew his hard earned share of the voyage\\'s\\n profits in a matter of days in the wine shops of Tyre. Nobody gets\\n quite so little for his money as that loneliest of all workers, he who\\n must leave his home for distant lands, returning only periodically and\\n usually with the salary of lengthy, weary periods of time to be spent\\n hurriedly in an attempt to achieve the pleasure and happiness so long\\n denied him.\\n\\n\\n Si was going to do it differently this time.\\n\\n\\n Nothing but the best. Wine, women, song, food, entertainment. The\\n works. But nothing but the best.\\nTo start off, he dressed with great care in the honorable\\n retirement-rank suit he had so recently purchased. His space pin he\\n attached carefully to the lapel. That was a good beginning, he decided.\\n A bit of prestige didn\\'t hurt you when you went out on the town. In\\n the Ultrawelfare State hardly one person in a hundred actually ever\\n performed anything of value to society. The efforts of most weren\\'t\\n needed. Those few who did contribute were awarded honors, decorations,\\n titles.\\n\\n\\n Attired satisfactorily, Si double-checked to see that his credit\\n card was in his pocket. As an after-thought, he went over to the\\n auto-apartment\\'s teevee-phone, flicked it on, held the card to the\\n screen and said, \"Balance check, please.\"\\n\\n\\n In a moment, the teevee-phone\\'s robot voice reported, \"Ten shares of\\n Inalienable Basic. Twelve shares of Variable Basic, current value, four\\n thousand, two hundred and thirty-three dollars and sixty-two cents\\n apiece. Current cash credit, one thousand and eighty-four dollars.\" The\\n screen went dead.\\n\\n\\n One thousand and eighty-four dollars. That was plenty. He could safely\\n spend as much as half of it, if the spree got as lively as he hoped it\\n would. His monthly dividends were due in another week or so, and he\\n wouldn\\'t have to worry about current expenses. Yes, indeedy, Si Pond\\n was as solvent as he had ever been in his thirty years.\\n\\n\\n He opened the small, closet-like door which housed his vacuum-tube\\n two-seater, and wedged himself into the small vehicle. He brought down\\n the canopy, dropped the pressurizer and considered the dial. Only one\\n place really made sense. The big city.\\n\\n\\n He considered for a moment, decided against the boroughs of Baltimore\\n and Boston, and selected Manhattan instead. He had the resources. He\\n might as well do it up brown.\\n\\n\\n He dialed Manhattan and felt the sinking sensation that presaged his\\n car\\'s dropping to tube level. While it was being taken up by the robot\\n controls, being shuttled here and there preparatory to the shot to his\\n destination, he dialed the vehicle\\'s teevee-phone for information on\\n the hotels of the island of the Hudson. He selected a swank hostelry\\n he\\'d read about and seen on the teevee casts of society and celebrity\\n gossip reporters, and dialed it on the car\\'s destination dial.\\n\\n\\n \"Nothing too good for ex-Space Pilot Si Pond,\" he said aloud.\\n\\n\\n The car hesitated for a moment, that brief hesitation before the\\n shot, and Si took the involuntary breath from which only heroes could\\n refrain. He sank back slowly into the seat. Moments passed, and the\\n direction of the pressure was reversed.\\n\\n\\n Manhattan. The shuttling began again, and one or two more traversing\\n sub-shots. Finally, the dash threw a green light and Si opened the\\n canopy and stepped into his hotel room.\\n\\n\\n A voice said gently, \"If the quarters are satisfactory, please present\\n your credit card within ten minutes.\"\\n\\n\\n Si took his time. Not that he really needed it. It was by far the most\\n swank suite he had ever seen. One wall was a window of whatever size\\n the guest might desire and Si touched the control that dilated it to\\n the full. His view opened in such wise that he could see both the\\n Empire State Building Museum and the Hudson. Beyond the river stretched\\n the all but endless city which was Greater Metropolis.\\n\\n\\n He didn\\'t take the time to flick on the menu, next to the auto-dining\\n table, nor to check the endless potables on the autobar list. All that,\\n he well knew, would be superlative. Besides, he didn\\'t plan to dine\\n or do much drinking in his suite. He made a mock leer. Not unless he\\n managed to acquire some feminine companionship, that was.\\n\\n\\n He looked briefly into the swimming pool and bath, then flopped\\n himself happily onto the bed. It wasn\\'t up to the degree of softness\\n he presently desired, and he dialed the thing to the ultimate in that\\n direction so that with a laugh he sank almost out of sight into the\\n mattress.\\n\\n\\n He came back to his feet, gave his suit a quick patting so that it\\n fell into press and, taking his credit card from his pocket, put it\\n against the teevee-phone screen and pressed the hotel button so that\\n registration could be completed.\\n\\n\\n For a moment he stood in the center of the floor, in thought. Take it\\n easy, Si Pond, take it all easy, this time. No throwing his dollars\\n around in second-class groggeries, no eating in automated luncheterias.\\n This time, be it the only time in his life, he was going to frolic in\\n the grand manner. No cloddy was Si Pond.\\n\\n\\n He decided a drink was in order to help him plan his strategy. A drink\\n at the hotel\\'s famous Kudos Room where celebrities were reputed to be a\\n dime a dozen.\\n\\n\\n He left the suite and stepped into one of the elevators. He said,\\n \"Kudos Room.\"\\n\\n\\n The auto-elevator murmured politely, \"Yes, sir, the Kudos Room.\"\\nAt the door to the famous rendezvous of the swankiest set, Si paused a\\n moment and looked about. He\\'d never been in a place like this, either.\\n However, he stifled his first instinct to wonder about what this was\\n going to do to his current credit balance with an inner grin and made\\n his way to the bar.\\n\\n\\n There was actually a bartender.\\n\\n\\n Si Pond suppressed his astonishment and said, offhand, attempting an\\n air of easy sophistication, \"Slivovitz Sour.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n The drinks in the Kudos Room might be concocted by hand, but Si noticed\\n they had the routine teevee screens built into the bar for payment.\\n He put his credit card on the screen immediately before him when the\\n drink came, and had to quell his desire to dial for a balance check, so\\n as to be able to figure out what the Sour had cost him.\\n\\n\\n Well, this was something like it. This was the sort of thing he\\'d\\n dreamed about, out there in the great alone, seated in the confining\\n conning tower of his space craft. He sipped at the drink, finding it up\\n to his highest expectations, and then swiveled slightly on his stool to\\n take a look at the others present.\\n\\n\\n To his disappointment, there were no recognizable celebrities. None\\n that he placed, at least—top teevee stars, top politicians of the\\n Ultrawelfare State or Sports personalities.\\n\\n\\n He turned back to his drink and noticed, for the first time, the girl\\n who occupied the stool two down from him. Si Pond blinked. He blinked\\n and then swallowed.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nZo-ro-as-ter\\n,\" he breathed.\\n\\n\\n She was done in the latest style from Shanghai, even to the point of\\n having cosmetically duplicated the Mongolian fold at the corners of her\\n eyes. Every pore, but\\nevery\\npore, was in place. She sat with the easy\\n grace of the Orient, so seldom found in the West.\\n\\n\\n His stare couldn\\'t be ignored.\\n\\n\\n She looked at him coldly, turned to the bartender and murmured, \"A Far\\n Out Cooler, please, Fredric.\" Then deliberately added, \"I thought the\\n Kudos Room was supposed to be exclusive.\"\\n\\n\\n There was nothing the bartender could say to that, and he went about\\n building the drink.\\n\\n\\n Si cleared his throat. \"Hey,\" he said, \"how about letting this one be\\n on me?\"\\n\\n\\n Her eyebrows, which had been plucked and penciled to carry out her\\n Oriental motif, rose. \"Really!\" she said, drawing it out.\\n\\n\\n The bartender said hurriedly, \"I beg your pardon, sir....\"\\n\\n\\n The girl, her voice suddenly subtly changed, said, \"Why, isn\\'t that a\\n space pin?\"\\n\\n\\n Si, disconcerted by the sudden reversal, said, \"Yeah ... sure.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Good Heavens, you\\'re a spaceman?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sure.\" He pointed at the lapel pin. \"You can\\'t wear one unless you\\n been on at least a Moon run.\"\\n\\n\\n She was obviously both taken back and impressed. \"Why,\" she said,\\n \"you\\'re Seymour Pond, the pilot. I tuned in on the banquet they gave\\n you.\"\\n\\n\\n Si, carrying his glass, moved over to the stool next to her. \"Call me\\n Si,\" he said. \"Everybody calls me Si.\"\\n\\n\\n She said, \"I\\'m Natalie. Natalie Paskov. Just Natalie. Imagine meeting\\n Seymour Pond. Just sitting down next to him at a bar. Just like that.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Si,\" Si said, gratified. Holy Zoroaster, he\\'d never seen anything\\n like this rarified pulchritude. Maybe on teevee, of course, one of the\\n current sex symbols, but never in person. \"Call me Si,\" he said again.\\n \"I been called Si so long, I don\\'t even know who somebody\\'s talking to\\n if they say Seymour.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I cried when they gave you that antique watch,\" she said, her tone\\n such that it was obvious she hadn\\'t quite adjusted as yet to having\\n met him.\\n\\n\\n Si Pond was surprised. \"Cried?\" he said. \"Well, why? I was kind of\\n bored with the whole thing. But old Doc Gubelin, I used to work under\\n him in the Space Exploration department, he was hot for it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nAcademician\\nGubelin?\" she said. \"You just call him\\nDoc\\n?\"\\n\\n\\n Si was expansive. \"Why, sure. In the Space Department we don\\'t have\\n much time for formality. Everybody\\'s just Si, and Doc, and Jim. Like\\n that. But how come you cried?\"\\nShe looked down into the drink the bartender had placed before her,\\n as though avoiding his face. \"I ... I suppose it was that speech\\n Doctor Girard-Perregaux made. There you stood, so fine and straight in\\n your space-pilot uniform, the veteran of six exploration runs to the\\n planets....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well,\" Si said modestly, \"two of my runs were only to the Moon.\"\\n\\n\\n \"... and he said all those things about man\\'s conquest of space. And\\n the dream of the stars which man has held so long. And then the fact\\n that you were the last of the space pilots. The last man in the whole\\n world trained to pilot a space craft. And here you were, retiring.\"\\n\\n\\n Si grunted. \"Yeah. That\\'s all part of the Doc\\'s scheme to get me to\\n take on another three runs. They\\'re afraid the whole department\\'ll be\\n dropped by the Appropriations Committee on this here Economic Planning\\n Board. Even if they can find some other patsy to train for the job,\\n it\\'d take maybe a year before you could even send him on a Moon hop.\\n So old man Gubelin, and Girard-Perregaux too, they\\'re both trying to\\n pressure me into more trips. Otherwise they got a Space Exploration\\n Department, with all the expense and all, but nobody to pilot their\\n ships. It\\'s kind of funny, in a way. You know what one of those\\n spaceships costs?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Funny?\" she said. \"Why, I don\\'t think it\\'s funny at all.\"\\n\\n\\n Si said, \"Look, how about another drink?\"\\n\\n\\n Natalie Paskov said, \"Oh, I\\'d love to have a drink with you, Mr....\"\\n\"Si,\" Si said. He motioned to the bartender with a circular twist of\\n the hand indicating their need for two more of the same. \"How come you\\n know so much about it? You don\\'t meet many people who are interested\\n in space any more. In fact, most people are almost contemptuous, like.\\n Think it\\'s kind of a big boondoggle deal to help use up a lot of\\n materials and all and keep the economy going.\"\\n\\n\\n Natalie said earnestly, \"Why, I\\'ve been a space fan all my life. I\\'ve\\n read all about it. Have always known the names of all the space pilots\\n and everything about them, ever since I was a child. I suppose you\\'d\\n say I have the dream that Doctor Girard-Perregaux spoke about.\"\\n\\n\\n Si chuckled. \"A real buff, eh? You know, it\\'s kind of funny. I was\\n never much interested in it. And I got a darn sight less interested\\n after my first run and I found out what space cafard was.\"\\n\\n\\n She frowned. \"I don\\'t believe I know much about that.\"\\n\\n\\n Sitting in the Kudos Room with the most beautiful girl to whom he had\\n ever talked, Si could be nonchalant about the subject. \"Old Gubelin\\n keeps that angle mostly hushed up and out of the magazine and newspaper\\n articles. Says there\\'s enough adverse publicity about space exploration\\n already. But at this stage of the game when the whole ship\\'s crammed\\n tight with this automatic scientific apparatus and all, there\\'s\\n precious little room in the conning tower and you\\'re the only man\\n aboard. The Doc says later on when ships are bigger and there\\'s a whole\\n flock of people aboard, there won\\'t be any such thing as space cafard,\\n but....\" Of a sudden the right side of Si Pond\\'s mouth began to tic\\n and he hurriedly took up his drink and knocked it back.\\n', 'question': 'Why is Si retirement so significant to the Space Exploration Team?

', \"YOUNG [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. \", \"copyright on this publication was renewed.]Every man's mind is a universe with countless places in which he can hide—even from himself!The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. \", 'Expurgated or not, however, it was still on the lascivious side. ', \"The G-string that constituted the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the nakedness which the original dance demanded. \", \"Nathan Blake's voice was slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the shadows at the back of the room. \", '\"Is she free?\" he asked. ', '\"I do not know, mensakin. ', 'Perhaps.\" Blake resumed watching. ', \"The girl's movements were a delicate blend of love and lust. \", 'Her face accompanied her body, eyes half-lidded one moment to match the languid motion of her limbs, wide and feral the next to match the furious bump and grind of her hips. ', 'For a chocoletto she was light-skinned—more bronze, really, than brown. ', 'But then, the word \"chocoletto\", coined by the early beche-la-mer traders, was misleading, and few of the natives of Dubhe 4\\'s southern-most continent lived up to it completely. ', 'She was beautiful too. ', 'Her high-cheekboned face was striking—the eyes dark-brown and wide-apart, the mouth sensuous, the teeth showing in a vivid white line between the half-parted purple lips. ', 'And her body was splendid. ', 'Blake had never seen anyone quite like her. ', 'He beckoned to her when the dance was over and, after slipping into a white thigh-length tunic, she joined him at his table. ', 'She ordered Martian wine in a liquid voice, and sipped it with a finesse that belied her cannibalistic forebears. ', '\"You wish a night?\" she asked. ', 'Blake nodded. ', '\"If you are free.\" \"Three thousand quandoes.\" He did not haggle, but counted out the amount and handed it to her. ', 'She slipped the bills into a thigh sheath-purse, told him her hut number and stood up to leave. ', '\"I will meet you there in an hour,\" she said.Her hut was as good a place to wait for her as any. ', 'After buying a bottle of native whiskey at the bar, Blake went out into the Dubhe 4 night and made his way through the labyrinthine alleys of the native sector. ', \"In common with all chocoletto huts, Eldoria's was uncared for on the outside, and gave a false impression of poverty. \", 'He expected to find the usual hanger-on waiting in the anteroom, and looked forward to booting him out into the alley. ', 'Instead he found a young girl— A human girl. ', 'He paused in the doorway. ', 'The girl was sitting cross-legged on a small mat, a book open on her lap. ', \"Xenophon'sAnabasis. \", 'Her hair made him think of the copper-colored sunrises of Norma 9 and her eyes reminded him of the blue tarns of Fornax 6. ', '\"Come in,\" she said. ', 'After closing the door, he sat down opposite her on the guest mat. ', \"Behind her, a gaudy arras hid the hut's other room. \", '\"You are here to wait for Eldoria?\" she asked. ', 'Blake nodded. ', '\"And you?\" She laughed. ', '\"I am here because I live here,\" she said. ', 'He tried to assimilate the information, but could not. ', 'Perceiving his difficulty, the girl went on, \"My parents indentured themselves to the Great Starway Cartel and were assigned to the rubber plantations of Dubhe 4. ', 'They died of yellow-water dysentery before their indenture ran out, and in accordance with Interstellar Law I was auctioned off along with the rest of their possessions. ', 'Eldoria bought me.\" Five years as a roving psycheye had hardened Blake to commercial colonization practices; nevertheless, he found the present example of man\\'s inhumanity to man sickening. ', '\"How old are you?\" Blake asked. ', '\"Fourteen.\" \"And what are you going to be when you grow up?\" \"Probably I shall be a psychiatrist. ', 'Eldoria is sending me to the mission school now, and afterward she is going to put me through an institute of higher learning. ', 'And when I come of age, she is going to give me my freedom.\" \"I see,\" Blake said. ', 'He indicated the book on her lap. ', '\"Homework?\" She shook her head. ', '\"In addition to my courses at the mission school, I am studying the humanities.\" \"Xenophon,\" Blake said. ', '\"And I suppose Plato too.\" \"And Homer and Virgil and Aeschylus and Euripides and all the rest of them. ', 'When I grow up I shall be a most well-educated person.\" \"I\\'m sure you will be,\" Blake said, looking at the arras. ', '\"My name is Deirdre.\" \"Nathan,\" Blake said. ', '\"Nathan Blake.\" \"Eldoria will be arriving soon. ', 'I must go and prepare her dais.\"She got up, parted the arras, and slipped into the next room. ', \"Shame flamed in Blake's cheeks, and for a moment he considered leaving; then he remembered Eldoria's dance, and he went right on sitting where he was. \", 'Presently the girl returned, and not long afterward the cloying scent of native incense crept beneath the arras and permeated the anteroom. ', 'She sat sideways on the mat this time, and he caught her face in profile. ', 'There was a suggestion of saintliness in the line of the nose and chin, a suggestion made all the more poignant by the slender column of the neck. ', 'He shifted uncomfortably on the guest mat. ', 'She had taken up theAnabasisagain, and silence was pounding silent fists upon the walls. ', 'He was relieved when Eldoria finally arrived. ', 'She ushered him into the next room immediately. ', 'It was slightly larger than the anteroom, and much more richly appointed. ', 'A thick carpet the color of Martian waterways lay upon the floor, contrasting pleasantly with the golden tapestries that adorned all four walls. ', 'The sleeping dais was oval and took up nearly half the floor space. ', 'It was strewn with scarlet cushions. ', 'Blake sat down upon it. ', 'Nervously he watched Eldoria slip out of her white street robe, his eyes moving back and forth from her smooth dark skin to the arras. ', 'The incense thickened around him. ', 'She noticed the back-and-forth movement of his eyes. ', '\"You need not fear the little one,\" she said, laying her hand upon his knee. ', '\"She will not enter.\" \"It\\'s not that so much,\" Blake said. ', '\"What?\" The warm bronze shoulder was touching his...', 'He rose up once in the night, thinking to find his hotel bed. ', 'His next awakening was in the grayness of dawn, and he got up and dressed and moved silently to the doorway. ', 'The girl slept just without the arras on a thin sleeping-mat, and he had to step over her to gain the anteroom. ', 'In sleep, a strand of her copper-colored hair had tumbled down across her forehead and lay like a lovely flower upon the virginal whiteness of her skin. ', 'There was something saintly about her quiet face. ', 'When he reached the alley he began to run, and he did not stop running till the chocoletto sector was far behind him.The hill was a memory-image and Aldebaran 12 rain-country hills were notoriously steep. ', 'Blake was breathing hard when he reached the crest. ', 'Before him lay a memory-image of a section of Deneb 1 wasteland. ', 'The image extended for no more than half a mile, but Blake was annoyed that he should have remembered even that much of the wretched terrain. ', \"Ideally, a man's mind-country should have been comprised only of the places and times he wanted to remember. \", 'Practically, however, that was far from being the case. ', 'He glanced back down into the rain-pocked valley that he had just crossed. ', 'The rain and the mist made for poor visibility. ', 'He could only faintly distinguish the three figures of his pursuers. ', 'The trio seemed a little closer now.Ever since he had first set foot into his mind, some ten hours ago, they had been on his trail, but for some reason he had been unable to bring himself to go back and find out who they were and what they wanted. ', 'Hence he was as vexed with himself as he was with them. ', 'After resting for a few minutes, he descended the hill and started across the Deneb 1 wasteland. ', \"It was a remarkably detailed materialization, and his quarry's footprints stood out clearly in the duplicated sand. \", 'Sabrina York did not even know the rudiments of the art of throwing off a mind-tracker. ', 'It would have done her but little good if she had, for twelve years as a psycheye had taught Blake all the tricks. ', \"Probably she had taken it for granted that the mere act of hiding out in her tracker's mind was in itself a sufficient guarantee of her safety. \", 'After all, she had no way of knowing that he had discovered her presence. ', 'Mind-country was as temporally inconsecutive as it was topographically incongruous, so Blake was not surprised when the Deneb 1 wasteland gave way to an expanse of boyhood meadow. ', 'Near the meadow was the house where Blake had lived at a much later date. ', 'In reality, the places were as far apart in miles as they were in years, but here in the country of his mind they existed side by side, surrounded by heterogeneous landscapes from all over the civilized sector of the galaxy and by the sharply demarcated spectra of a hundred different suns. ', 'A few of the suns were in the patchwork sky—Sirius, for example, and its twinkling dwarf companion. ', 'Most of them, however, were present only in their remembered radiance. ', 'To add to the confusion, scattered night memories interrupted the hodge-podge horizon with columns of darkness, and here and there the gray column of a dawn or dusk memory showed. ', 'The house was flanked on one side by a section of a New Earth spaceport and on the other by an excerpt of an Ex-earth city-block. ', 'Behind it flowed a brief blue stretch of Martian waterway. ', \"Sabrina's footsteps led up to the front door, and the door itself was ajar. \", 'Perhaps she was still inside. ', 'Perhaps she was watching him even now through one of the remembered windows. ', 'He scanned them with a professional eye, but saw no sign of her. ', 'Warily he stepped inside, adjusting the temperature of his all-weather jacket to the remembered air-conditioning. ', 'His father was sitting in the living room, smoking, and watching 3V. ', 'He had no awareness of Blake. ', \"At Blake's entry he went right on smoking and watching as though the door had neither opened nor closed. \", \"He would go right on smoking and watching till Blake died and the conglomeration of place-times that constituted Blake's mind-world ceased to be. \", 'Ironically, he was watching nothing. ', \"The 3V program that had been in progress at the time of the unconscious materialization had failed to come through.The memory was a treasured one—the old man had perished in a 'copter crash several years ago—and for a long while Blake did not move. \", 'He had never been in his own mind before. ', 'Consequently he was more affected than he might otherwise have been. ', 'Finally, stirring himself, he walked out into the kitchen. ', \"On a shelf above the sink stood a gaily colored box of his mother's favorite detergent with a full-length drawing of Vera Velvetskin, the company's blond and chic visual symbol, on the front. \", 'His mother was standing before the huge automatic range, preparing a meal she had served twenty-three years ago. ', 'He regarded her with moist eyes. ', 'She had died a dozen years before his father, but the wound that her death had caused had never healed. ', 'He wanted to go up behind her and touch her shoulder and say, \"What\\'s for supper, mom?\" but he knew it would do no good. ', 'For her he had no reality, not only because he was far in her future, but because in his mind-world she was a mortal and he, a god—a picayune god, perhaps, but a real one. ', 'As he was about to turn away, the name-plate on the range caught his eye, and thinking that he had read the two words wrong, he stepped closer so that he could see them more clearly. ', 'No, he had made no mistake: the first word was \"Sabrina\", and the second was \"York\". ', 'He stepped back. ', 'Odd that a kitchen range should have the same name as his quarry. ', 'But perhaps not unduly so. ', 'Giving appliances human names had been common practice for centuries. ', 'Even a name like \"Sabrina York\", while certainly not run-of-the-mill, was bound to be duplicated in real life. ', 'Nevertheless a feeling of uneasiness accompanied him when he left the kitchen and climbed the stairs to the second floor. ', 'He went through each room systematically, but saw no sign of Sabrina York. ', 'He lingered for some time in his own room, wistfully watching his fifteen-year-old self lolling on the bed with a dog-eared copy ofThe Galaxy Boys and the Secret of the Crab Nebula, then he stepped back out into the hall and started to descend the stairs. ', 'At the head of the stairs a narrow window looked out over the front yard and thence out over the meadow. ', 'He glanced absently through the panes, and came to an abrupt halt. ', 'His three pursuers were wading through the long meadow grass less than a quarter of a mile away—not close enough as yet for him to be able to make out their faces, but close enough for him to be able to see that two of them were wearing dresses and that the third had on a blue skirt and blouse, and a kepi to match. ', 'He gasped. ', \"It simply hadn't occurred to him that his pursuers might be women. \", 'To his consternation he discovered that he was even more loath to go back and accost them than he had been before. ', 'He actually had an impulse to flee. ', 'He controlled it and descended the stairs with exaggerated slowness, leaving the house by way of the back door. ', \"He picked up Sabrina's trail in the back yard and followed it down to the Martian waterway and thence along the bank to where the waterway ended and a campus began. \", \"Not the campus of the university which he had visited two days ago to attend his protegee's graduation. \", \"It was not a place-time that he cared to revisit, nor a moment that he cared to relive, but Sabrina's trail led straight across the artificially stunted grass toward the little bench where he and Deirdre Eldoria had come to talk after the ceremony was over. \", 'He had no choice.The bench stood beneath a towering American elm whose feathery branches traced green arabesques against the blue June sky. ', 'A set of footprints slightly deeper than its predecessors indicated that Sabrina had paused by the trunk. ', 'Despite himself Blake paused there too. ', \"Pain tightened his throat when he looked at Deirdre's delicate profile and copper-colored hair, intensified when he lowered his eyes to the remembered blueness of her graduation dress. \", 'The diamond brooch that he had given her as a graduation present, and which she had proudly pinned upon her bodice for the whole wide world to see, made him want to cry. ', 'His self-image of two weeks ago shocked him. ', 'There were lines on the face that did not as yet exist, and the brown hair was shot with streaks of gray that had yet to come into being. ', 'Lord, he must have been feeling old to have pictured himself like that! Deirdre was speaking. ', '\"Yes,\" she was saying, \"at nine o\\'clock. ', 'And I should very much like for you to come.\" Blake Past shook his head. ', '\"Proms aren\\'t for parents. ', 'You know that as well as I do. ', \"That young man you were talking with a few minutes ago—he's the one who should take you. \", 'He\\'d give his right arm for the chance.\" \"I\\'ll thank you not to imply that you\\'re my father. ', 'One would think from the way you talk that you are centuries old!\" \"I\\'m thirty-eight,\" Blake Past said, \"and while I may not be your father, I\\'m certainly old enough to be. ', 'That young man—\" A pink flush of anger climbed into Deirdre Eldoria\\'s girlish cheeks. ', '\"What right hashegot to take me! Didhescrimp and go without in order to put me through high school and college? Hashebooked passage for me to New Earth and paid my tuition to Trevor University?\" \"Please,\" Blake Past said, desperation deepening his voice. ', '\"You\\'re only making everything worse. ', 'After majoring in Trevorism, you certainly ought to realize by now that there was nothing noble about my buying you after Eldoria died. ', 'I only did it to ease my conscience—\" \"What doyouknow about conscience?\" Deirdre demanded. ', '\"Conscience is a much more complex mechanism than most laymen realize. ', \"Guilt feelings aren't reliable criteria. \", 'They can stem from false causes—from ridiculous things like a person\\'s inability to accept himself for what he is.\" Abruptly she dropped the subject. ', '\"Don\\'t you realize, Nate,\" she went on a little desperately, \"that I\\'m leaving tomorrow and that we won\\'t see each other again for years and years?\" \"I\\'ll come to New Earth to visit you,\" Blake said. ', '\"Venus is only a few days distant on the new ships.\" She stood up. ', '\"You won\\'t come—I know you won\\'t.\" She stamped her foot. ', '\"And you won\\'t come to the prom either. ', 'I know that too. ', 'I knew it all along. ', 'Sometimes I\\'m tempted to—\" Abruptly she broke off. ', '\"Very well then,\" she went on, \"I\\'ll say good-by now then.\" Blake Past stood up too. ', '\"No, not yet. ', 'I\\'ll walk back to the sorority house with you.\" She tossed her head, but the sadness in her tarn-blue eyes belied her hauteur. ', '\"If you wish,\" she said.Blake Present watched them set out side by side toward the remembered halls of learning that showed in the distance. ', \"There had been other people present on the campus that afternoon, but as they had failed to register on Blake Past's mind, they did not exist for Blake Present. \", 'All that existed for Blake Present were the diminishing figures of the girl and the man, and the pain that was constricting his throat. ', 'Wretchedly he turned away. ', 'As he did so he saw the three shadows lying at his feet and knew that his pursuers had at last caught up to him. ', 'His first reaction when he faced them was amazement. ', 'His next reaction was shock. ', 'His third was fear. ', 'His amazement resulted from recognition. ', 'One of the three women arrayed before him was Miss Stoddart, his boyhood Sunday-school teacher. ', 'Standing next to her in a familiar blue uniform was Officer Finch, the police woman who had maintained law and order in the collective elementary school he had attended. ', \"Standing next to Officer Finch was blond and chic Vera Velvetskin, whose picture he had seen on box after countless box of his mother's favorite detergent. \", 'His shock resulted from the expressions on the three faces. ', 'Neither Miss Stoddart nor Officer Finch ever particularly liked him, but they had never particularly disliked him either. ', 'This Miss Stoddart and this Officer Finch disliked him, though. ', 'They hated him. ', 'They hated him so much that their hatred had thinned out their faces and darkened their eyes. ', \"More shocking yet, Vera Velvetskin, who had never existed save in some copywriter's mind, hated him too. \", 'In fact, judging from the greater thinness of her face and the more pronounced darkness of her eyes, she hated him even more than Miss Stoddart and Officer Finch did. ', 'His fear resulted from the realization that his mind-world contained phenomena it had no right to contain—not if he was nearly as well-adjusted as he considered himself to be. ', 'The three women standing before him definitely were not memory-images. ', 'They were too vivid, for one thing. ', 'For another, they were aware of him. ', 'What were they, then? And what were they doing in his mind? He asked the two questions aloud. ', 'Three arms were raised and three forefingers were pointed accusingly at his chest. ', 'Three pairs of eyes burned darkly. ', '\"You ask us that?\" Miss Stoddart said. ', '\"Callous creature who did a maiden\\'s innocence affront!\" said Officer Finch. ', '\"And sought sanctuary in ill-fitting robes of righteousness!\" said Vera Velvetskin. ', 'The three faces moved together, blurred and seemed to blend into one.

', 'Then he turned and fled.It had taken man a long time to discover that he was a god in his own right and that he too was capable of creating universes. ', 'Trivial universes, to be sure, when compared with the grandeur and scope of the objective one, and peopled with ghosts instead of human beings; but universes nonetheless. ', 'The discovery came about quite by accident. ', \"After projecting himself into a patient's memory one day, a psychologist named Trevor suddenly found himself clinging to the slope of a traumatically distorted mountain. \", 'His patient was beside him. ', \"The mountain proved to be an unconscious memory-image out of the patient's boyhood, and its country proved to be the country of the patient's mind. \", 'After many trials and errors, Trevor managed to get both himself and his patient back to the objective world, and not long afterward he was able to duplicate the feat on another case. ', 'The next logical step was to enter his own mind, and this he also succeeded in doing. ', 'It was inevitable that Trevor should write a book about his discovery and set about founding a new school of psychology. ', 'It was equally inevitable that he should acquire enemies as well as disciples. ', 'However, as the years passed and the new therapy which he devised cured more and more psychoses, the ranks of his disciples swelled and those of his enemies shrank. ', 'When, shortly before his death, he published a paper explaining how anyone could enter his or her own mind-world at will, his niche in the Freudian hall of fame was assured. ', 'The method employed an ability that had been evolving in the human mind for millennia—the ability to project oneself into a past moment—or, to use Trevor\\'s term, a past \"place-time.\" Considerable practice was required before the first transition could be achieved, but once it was achieved, successive transitions became progressively easier. ', \"Entering another person's mind-world was of course a more difficult undertaking, and could be achieved only after an intensive study of a certain moment in that person's past. \", 'In order to return to the objective world, it was necessary in both cases to locate the most recently materialized place-time and take one step beyond it. ', 'By their very nature, mind-countries were confusing. ', 'They existed on a plane of reality that bore no apparent relationship to the plane of the so-called objective universe. ', 'In fact, so far as was known, this secondary—or subjective—reality was connected to so-called true reality only through the awareness of the various creators. ', 'In addition, these countries had no outward shape in the ordinary sense of the word, and while most countries contained certain parallel images, these images were subject to the interpretation of the individual creator. ', 'As a result they were seldom identical.It was inevitable that sooner or later some criminal would hit upon the idea of hiding out in his own mind-world till the statute of limitations that applied to his particular crime ran out, and it was equally inevitable that others should follow suit. ', \"Society's answer was the psyche-police, and the psyche-police hadn't been in action very long before the first private psycheye appeared. \", 'Blake was one of a long line of such operators. ', \"So far as he knew, the present case represented the first time a criminal had ever hidden out in the pursuer's mind. \", 'It would have been a superb stratagem indeed if, shortly after her entry, Sabrina York had not betrayed her presence. ', 'For her point of entry she had used the place-time materialization of the little office Blake had opened on Ex-earth at the beginning of his career. ', 'Unaccountably she had ransacked it before moving into a co-terminous memory-image. ', \"Even this action wouldn't have given her away, however, if the office hadn't constituted a sentimental memory. \", \"Whenever Blake accepted a case he invariably thought of the bleak and lonely little room with its thin-gauge steel desk and battered filing cabinets, and when he had done so after accepting his case—or was it before? He couldn't quite remember—the mental picture that had come into his mind had revealed open drawers, scattered papers and a general air of disarray. \", 'He had suspected the truth immediately, and when he had seen the woman\\'s handkerchief with the initials \"SB\" embroidered on it lying by one of the filing cabinets he had known definitely that his quarry was hiding out in his mind. ', 'Retiring to his bachelor quarters, he had entered at the same place-time and set off in pursuit. ', 'Her only advantage lost, Sabrina York was now at his mercy. ', 'Unless she discovered his presence and was able to locate his most recently materialized place-time before he over-took her, her capture was assured. ', 'Only two things bothered Blake. ', 'The little office was far in his past, and it was unlikely that anyone save the few intimate acquaintances whom he had told about it were aware that it had ever existed. ', 'How, then, had a total stranger such as Sabrina York learned enough about it to enable her to use it as a point of entry? The other thing that bothered him was of a much more urgent nature. ', 'He had been in enough minds and he had read enough on the subject of Trevorism to know that people were sometimes capable of creating beings considerably higher on the scale of mind-country evolution than ordinary memory-ghosts. ', 'One woman whom he had apprehended in her own mind had created a walking-talking Virgin Mary who watched over her wherever she went. ', 'And once, after tracking down an ex-enlisted man, he had found his quarry holed up in the memory-image of an army barracks with a ten-star general waiting on him hand and foot. ', 'But these, and other, similar, cases, had to do with mal-adjusted people, and moreover, the super-image in each instance had been an image that the person involved hadwantedto create. ', \"Therefore, even assuming that Blake was less well-adjusted than he considered himself to be, why had he created three such malevolent super-images as Miss Stoddart, Officer Finch, and Vera Velvetskin?They followed him off the campus into a vicarious memory-image of Walden Pond, Thoreau's shack, and the encompassing woods. \", 'Judging from the ecstatic \"oh\\'s\" and \"ah\\'s\" they kept giving voice to, the place delighted them. ', \"Once, glancing back over his shoulder, he saw them standing in front of Thoreau's shack, looking at it as though it were a doll's house. \", 'Not far away, Thoreau was sitting in under a tall pine, gazing up into the branches at a bird that had come through only as a vague blur of beak and feathers. ', 'Blake went on. ', 'Presently the Walden Pond memory-image gave way to a memory-image of an English park which the ex-Earth government had set aside as a memorial to the English poets and which had impressed Blake sufficiently when he had visited it in his youth to have found a place for itself in the country of his mind. ', 'It consisted of reconstructions of famous dwellings out of the lives of the poets, among them, a dwelling out of the life of a poet who was not in the strictest sense of the word English at all—the birthplace of Robert Burns. ', \"Oddly enough, it was Burns's birthplace that had impressed Blake most. \", 'Now the little cottage stood out in much more vivid detail than any of the other famous dwellings. ', 'Sabrina York must have been attracted to the place, for her footprints showed that she had turned in at the gate, walked up the little path and let herself in the door. ', 'They also showed that she had left by the same route, so there was no reason for Blake to linger. ', 'As a matter of fact, the fascination that had brought the place into being had been replaced by an illogical repugnance. ', 'But repugnance can sometimes be as compelling a force as fascination, and Blake not only lingered but went inside as well. ', 'He remembered the living room distinctly—the flagstone floor, the huge grill-fronted hearth, the deeply recessed window, the rack of cups and platters on the wall; the empty straight-backed chair standing sternly in a corner, the bare wooden table— He paused just within the doorway. ', 'The chair was no longer empty, the table no longer bare. ', 'A man sat on the former and a bottle of wine stood on the latter. ', 'Moreover, the room showed signs of having been lived in for a long time. ', 'The floor was covered with tracked-in dirt and the walls were blackened from smoke. ', 'The grill-work of the hearth was begrimed with grease.']\n","[['THE GIRL IN HIS MINDBy ROBERT F.

', 'The girl slept just without the arras on a thin sleeping-mat, and he had to step over her to gain the anteroom. ', 'In sleep, a strand of her copper-colored hair had tumbled down across her forehead and lay like a lovely flower upon the virginal whiteness of her skin. '], ['There was something saintly about her quiet face. ', 'When he reached the alley he began to run, and he did not stop running till the chocoletto sector was far behind him.The hill was a memory-image and Aldebaran 12 rain-country hills were notoriously steep. ', 'Blake was breathing hard when he reached the crest. ', 'Before him lay a memory-image of a section of Deneb 1 wasteland. ', 'The image extended for no more than half a mile, but Blake was annoyed that he should have remembered even that much of the wretched terrain. ', \"Ideally, a man's mind-country should have been comprised only of the places and times he wanted to remember. \", 'Practically, however, that was far from being the case. ', 'He glanced back down into the rain-pocked valley that he had just crossed. '], ['The rain and the mist made for poor visibility. '], ['He could only faintly distinguish the three figures of his pursuers.

', 'Hence he was as vexed with himself as he was with them. ', 'After resting for a few minutes, he descended the hill and started across the Deneb 1 wasteland. '], [\"It was a remarkably detailed materialization, and his quarry's footprints stood out clearly in the duplicated sand. \", 'Sabrina York did not even know the rudiments of the art of throwing off a mind-tracker. ', 'It would have done her but little good if she had, for twelve years as a psycheye had taught Blake all the tricks. ', \"Probably she had taken it for granted that the mere act of hiding out in her tracker's mind was in itself a sufficient guarantee of her safety. \"], ['After all, she had no way of knowing that he had discovered her presence. ', 'Mind-country was as temporally inconsecutive as it was topographically incongruous, so Blake was not surprised when the Deneb 1 wasteland gave way to an expanse of boyhood meadow. '], ['Near the meadow was the house where Blake had lived at a much later date. ', 'In reality, the places were as far apart in miles as they were in years, but here in the country of his mind they existed side by side, surrounded by heterogeneous landscapes from all over the civilized sector of the galaxy and by the sharply demarcated spectra of a hundred different suns. '], ['A few of the suns were in the patchwork sky—Sirius, for example, and its twinkling dwarf companion. '], ['Most of them, however, were present only in their remembered radiance. '], ['To add to the confusion, scattered night memories interrupted the hodge-podge horizon with columns of darkness, and here and there the gray column of a dawn or dusk memory showed. ', 'The house was flanked on one side by a section of a New Earth spaceport and on the other by an excerpt of an Ex-earth city-block. '], ['Behind it flowed a brief blue stretch of Martian waterway. ', \"Sabrina's footsteps led up to the front door, and the door itself was ajar. \"], ['Perhaps she was still inside. '], ['Perhaps she was watching him even now through one of the remembered windows. '], ['He scanned them with a professional eye, but saw no sign of her. ', 'Warily he stepped inside, adjusting the temperature of his all-weather jacket to the remembered air-conditioning. '], ['His father was sitting in the living room, smoking, and watching 3V. ', 'He had no awareness of Blake. '], [\"At Blake's entry he went right on smoking and watching as though the door had neither opened nor closed. \"], [\"He would go right on smoking and watching till Blake died and the conglomeration of place-times that constituted Blake's mind-world ceased to be. \"], ['Ironically, he was watching nothing. ', \"The 3V program that had been in progress at the time of the unconscious materialization had failed to come through.The memory was a treasured one—the old man had perished in a 'copter crash several years ago—and for a long while Blake did not move. \", 'He had never been in his own mind before. '], ['Consequently he was more affected than he might otherwise have been. ', 'Finally, stirring himself, he walked out into the kitchen. ', \"On a shelf above the sink stood a gaily colored box of his mother's favorite detergent with a full-length drawing of Vera Velvetskin, the company's blond and chic visual symbol, on the front. \"], ['His mother was standing before the huge automatic range, preparing a meal she had served twenty-three years ago.

'], ['He wanted to go up behind her and touch her shoulder and say, \"What\\'s for supper, mom?\" but he knew it would do no good. ', 'For her he had no reality, not only because he was far in her future, but because in his mind-world she was a mortal and he, a god—a picayune god, perhaps, but a real one. ', 'As he was about to turn away, the name-plate on the range caught his eye, and thinking that he had read the two words wrong, he stepped closer so that he could see them more clearly. '], ['No, he had made no mistake: the first word was \"Sabrina\", and the second was \"York\". ', 'He stepped back. ', 'Odd that a kitchen range should have the same name as his quarry. ', 'But perhaps not unduly so. ', 'Giving appliances human names had been common practice for centuries. ', 'Even a name like \"Sabrina York\", while certainly not run-of-the-mill, was bound to be duplicated in real life. ', 'Nevertheless a feeling of uneasiness accompanied him when he left the kitchen and climbed the stairs to the second floor. '], ['He went through each room systematically, but saw no sign of Sabrina York. ', 'He lingered for some time in his own room, wistfully watching his fifteen-year-old self lolling on the bed with a dog-eared copy ofThe Galaxy Boys and the Secret of the Crab Nebula, then he stepped back out into the hall and started to descend the stairs. '], ['At the head of the stairs a narrow window looked out over the front yard and thence out over the meadow. '], ['He glanced absently through the panes, and came to an abrupt halt. ', 'His three pursuers were wading through the long meadow grass less than a quarter of a mile away—not close enough as yet for him to be able to make out their faces, but close enough for him to be able to see that two of them were wearing dresses and that the third had on a blue skirt and blouse, and a kepi to match. ', 'He gasped. ', \"It simply hadn't occurred to him that his pursuers might be women. \"], ['To his consternation he discovered that he was even more loath to go back and accost them than he had been before. '], ['He actually had an impulse to flee. '], ['He controlled it and descended the stairs with exaggerated slowness, leaving the house by way of the back door. ', \"He picked up Sabrina's trail in the back yard and followed it down to the Martian waterway and thence along the bank to where the waterway ended and a campus began. \"], [\"Not the campus of the university which he had visited two days ago to attend his protegee's graduation. \"], [\"It was not a place-time that he cared to revisit, nor a moment that he cared to relive, but Sabrina's trail led straight across the artificially stunted grass toward the little bench where he and Deirdre Eldoria had come to talk after the ceremony was over. \"], ['He had no choice.The bench stood beneath a towering American elm whose feathery branches traced green arabesques against the blue June sky. ', 'A set of footprints slightly deeper than its predecessors indicated that Sabrina had paused by the trunk. ', 'Despite himself Blake paused there too.

', 'His self-image of two weeks ago shocked him. ', 'There were lines on the face that did not as yet exist, and the brown hair was shot with streaks of gray that had yet to come into being.

', 'As a result they were seldom identical.It was inevitable that sooner or later some criminal would hit upon the idea of hiding out in his own mind-world till the statute of limitations that applied to his particular crime ran out, and it was equally inevitable that others should follow suit. ', \"Society's answer was the psyche-police, and the psyche-police hadn't been in action very long before the first private psycheye appeared. \", 'Blake was one of a long line of such operators. ', \"So far as he knew, the present case represented the first time a criminal had ever hidden out in the pursuer's mind. \", 'It would have been a superb stratagem indeed if, shortly after her entry, Sabrina York had not betrayed her presence. ', 'For her point of entry she had used the place-time materialization of the little office Blake had opened on Ex-earth at the beginning of his career. ', 'Unaccountably she had ransacked it before moving into a co-terminous memory-image. '], [\"Even this action wouldn't have given her away, however, if the office hadn't constituted a sentimental memory. \", \"Whenever Blake accepted a case he invariably thought of the bleak and lonely little room with its thin-gauge steel desk and battered filing cabinets, and when he had done so after accepting his case—or was it before? He couldn't quite remember—the mental picture that had come into his mind had revealed open drawers, scattered papers and a general air of disarray. \"], ['He had suspected the truth immediately, and when he had seen the woman\\'s handkerchief with the initials \"SB\" embroidered on it lying by one of the filing cabinets he had known definitely that his quarry was hiding out in his mind. '], ['Retiring to his bachelor quarters, he had entered at the same place-time and set off in pursuit. ', 'Her only advantage lost, Sabrina York was now at his mercy. '], ['Unless she discovered his presence and was able to locate his most recently materialized place-time before he over-took her, her capture was assured. ', 'Only two things bothered Blake. ', 'The little office was far in his past, and it was unlikely that anyone save the few intimate acquaintances whom he had told about it were aware that it had ever existed. ', 'How, then, had a total stranger such as Sabrina York learned enough about it to enable her to use it as a point of entry? The other thing that bothered him was of a much more urgent nature. ', 'He had been in enough minds and he had read enough on the subject of Trevorism to know that people were sometimes capable of creating beings considerably higher on the scale of mind-country evolution than ordinary memory-ghosts. ', 'One woman whom he had apprehended in her own mind had created a walking-talking Virgin Mary who watched over her wherever she went. ', 'And once, after tracking down an ex-enlisted man, he had found his quarry holed up in the memory-image of an army barracks with a ten-star general waiting on him hand and foot. ', 'But these, and other, similar, cases, had to do with mal-adjusted people, and moreover, the super-image in each instance had been an image that the person involved hadwantedto create. ', \"Therefore, even assuming that Blake was less well-adjusted than he considered himself to be, why had he created three such malevolent super-images as Miss Stoddart, Officer Finch, and Vera Velvetskin?They followed him off the campus into a vicarious memory-image of Walden Pond, Thoreau's shack, and the encompassing woods. \", 'Judging from the ecstatic \"oh\\'s\" and \"ah\\'s\" they kept giving voice to, the place delighted them. '], [\"Once, glancing back over his shoulder, he saw them standing in front of Thoreau's shack, looking at it as though it were a doll's house. \"], ['Not far away, Thoreau was sitting in under a tall pine, gazing up into the branches at a bird that had come through only as a vague blur of beak and feathers. ', 'Blake went on. ', 'Presently the Walden Pond memory-image gave way to a memory-image of an English park which the ex-Earth government had set aside as a memorial to the English poets and which had impressed Blake sufficiently when he had visited it in his youth to have found a place for itself in the country of his mind. '], ['It consisted of reconstructions of famous dwellings out of the lives of the poets, among them, a dwelling out of the life of a poet who was not in the strictest sense of the word English at all—the birthplace of Robert Burns. ', \"Oddly enough, it was Burns's birthplace that had impressed Blake most. \", 'Now the little cottage stood out in much more vivid detail than any of the other famous dwellings. ', 'Sabrina York must have been attracted to the place, for her footprints showed that she had turned in at the gate, walked up the little path and let herself in the door. ', 'They also showed that she had left by the same route, so there was no reason for Blake to linger. ', 'As a matter of fact, the fascination that had brought the place into being had been replaced by an illogical repugnance. '], ['But repugnance can sometimes be as compelling a force as fascination, and Blake not only lingered but went inside as well. ', 'He remembered the living room distinctly—the flagstone floor, the huge grill-fronted hearth, the deeply recessed window, the rack of cups and platters on the wall; the empty straight-backed chair standing sternly in a corner, the bare wooden table— He paused just within the doorway. '], ['The chair was no longer empty, the table no longer bare. '], ['A man sat on the former and a bottle of wine stood on the latter. ', 'Moreover, the room showed signs of having been lived in for a long time. '], ['The floor was covered with tracked-in dirt and the walls were blackened from smoke. '], ['The grill-work of the hearth was begrimed with grease.']]\n"]}]}],"metadata":{"accelerator":"GPU","colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"1oIim0JmbEyeQdEZcGNa3ObgbjmOgV2go","timestamp":1688759042882}],"gpuType":"T4"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
